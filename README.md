# Tests of group equivariant neural networks
The test is using the groupy package by Taco Cohen (found at https://github.com/tscohen/GrouPy) as well as the keras_gcnn package by Bas Veeling (found at https://github.com/basveeling/keras-gcnn). Please visit their GitHub for downloads and further details.

The network created in the test is a minimal working model and is not optimised for niether accuracy nor loss.
